# SBAS Prototype

This repository serves the configuration for SBAS nodes and clients, dynamically
generated from a single config file.

Information about the nodes that make up the SBAS is stored in `nodes.json`.
From this information, the configurations in the directories `node` (for SBAS
nodes) and `client` (for SBAS customers) are generated.
