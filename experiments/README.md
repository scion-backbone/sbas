# Experiments

The infrastructure is designed as follows:
A (local) machine serves as command-and-control and uses SSH connections to SBAS nodes and customers to orchestrate experiments.

## Requirements

- Nodes must be fully provisioned and connected to SCIONLab.
- Customers used in the experiment must be set up according to the description in the `client` directory under the repository root.
